Carbide,
 
D2
 
Tool
 
Steel,
 
and
 
Cast
 
Iron.
6  
2.  Lifecycle  Support:  By  offering  Magnetic  Separators  and  Coolant  Filter  Paper  alongside  
the
 
grinding
 
machines,
 
Grindstone
 
positions
 
itself
 
as
 
a
 
solution
 
provider
 
for
 
the
 
entire
 
"Grinding
 
Cell,"
 
not
 
just
 
the
 
machine
 
tool
 
vendor.
8  
3.  Process  Versatility:  The  equipment  spans  manual,  semi-automatic,  and  hydraulic  
actuation,
 
catering
 
to
 
both
 
cost-sensitive
 
job
 
shops
 
and
 
high-throughput
 
production
 
lines.
2  
2.  Dominant  Product  Category:  Cylindrical  Grinding  
Technology
 2.1  The  Engineering  Context  of  Cylindrical  Grinding  
Cylindrical  grinding  is  the  backbone  of  the  company's  offering,  comprising  49  distinct  product  
listings.
2
 This  process  is  critical  for  producing  precision  shafts,  rollers,  and  pins  where  
tolerances
 
are
 
measured
 
in
 
single-digit
 
microns.
 
Grindstone
 
Machinery
 
Industries
 
segments
 
this
 
technology
 
into
 
Hydraulic,
 
Manual,
 
and
 
CNC
 
variants
 
to
 
address
 
distinct
 
market
 
needs.
 
2.2  Hydraulic  Cylindrical  Grinding  Machines  

The  hydraulic  series  represents  the  firm’s  commitment  to  semi-automation.  Hydraulic  systems  
in
 
grinding
 
machines
 
are
 
primarily
 
used
 
to
 
drive
 
the
 
longitudinal
 
traverse
 
of
 
the
 
table.
 
This
 
ensures
 
a
 
consistent,
 
smooth
 
motion
 
that
 
is
 
impossible
 
to
 
achieve
 
by
 
hand,
 
resulting
 
in
 
superior
 
surface
 
finish
 
values
 
(Ra).
 
2.2.1  600mm  Hydraulic  Universal  Cylindrical  Grinder  This  machine  is  the  flagship  model  for  tool  rooms  and  maintenance  workshops.  The  term  
"Universal"
 
implies
 
a
 
swiveling
 
wheel
 
head
 
and
 
work
 
head,
 
allowing
 
for
 
the
 
machining
 
of
 
steep
 
tapers
 
and
 
complex
 
geometries.
 
Structural  &  Functional  Analysis:  ●  Capacity  &  Envelope:  The  machine  admits  600  mm  between  centers,  accommodating  
medium-sized
 
shafts
 
typical
 
of
 
electric
 
motors
 
and
 
automotive
 
transmission
 
components.
10
 The  299  mm  swing  over  bed  allows  for  the  rotation  of  bulky  components  
with
 
flanges.
10  
●  Work  Head  Dynamics:  The  work  head  features  a  swivel  capacity  of  45  degrees.  This  is  a  
critical
 
feature
 
for
 
grinding
 
tapered
 
surfaces,
 
such
 
as
 
Morse
 
Tapers
 
or
 
sealing
 
faces.
10  
●  Wheel  Head  Architecture:  ○  Wheel  Size:  400  mm  (Dia)  x  40  mm  (Width)  x  127  mm  (Bore).  The  large  400  mm  
wheel
 
offers
 
a
 
significant
 
peripheral
 
speed
 
advantage
 
and
 
longer
 
wheel
 
life
 
compared
 
to
 
smaller
 
standards.
10  
○  Speed  Control:  Two-step  pulley  system  offering  1900  RPM  and  2100  RPM.  This  
allows
 
operators
 
to
 
adjust
 
speed
 
as
 
the
 
wheel
 
diameter
 
decreases
 
due
 
to
 
wear,
 
maintaining
 
constant
 
surface
 
feet
 
per
 
minute
 
(SFPM).
10  
●  Dual-Process  Capability:  A  defining  feature  is  the  Internal  Grinding  Attachment .  The  
machine
 
supports
 
ID
 
spindles
 
of
 
45,
 
60,
 
and
 
80
 
mm
 
diameter,
 
effectively
 
serving
 
as
 
two
 
machines
 
in
 
one
 
(OD
 
and
 
ID
 
grinder).

Insight:  The  inclusion  of  a  0-20  second  "Dwell  at  Reversals"  
10
 is  a  sophisticated  hydraulic  
feature.
 
It
 
allows
 
the
 
grinding
 
wheel
 
to
 
spark
 
out
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
a
 
pass,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
shoulder
 
of
 
the
 
shaft
 
is
 
perfectly
 
perpendicular
 
to
 
the
 
axis—a
 
requirement
 
for
 
high-precision
 
bearing
 
fits.
 
2.2.2  300mm  Hydraulic  Cylindrical  Grinder  A  compact  powerhouse  designed  for  the  production  of  small,  high-precision  parts  like  fuel  
injection
 
pins,
 
hydraulic
 
spools,
 
and
 
bushings.
 
Technical  Specifications:  
●  Center  Distance:  300  mm.
9  
●  Swing  Over  Bed:  200  mm.
12  
●  Automation:  Semi-Automatic  Hydraulic  Traverse.
9  
●  Max  Grinding  Diameter:  200  mm.
9  
●  Wheel  Size:  350  x  40  mm.
9  
Insight:  Despite  its  smaller  footprint,  this  machine  maintains  a  robust  40mm  wheel  width,  
allowing
 
for
 
"Plunge
 
Grinding"
 
(where
 
the
 
wheel
 
is
 
fed
 
radially
 
into
 
the
 
part
 
without
 
traversing).
 
This
 
makes
 
it
 
faster
 
for
 
mass
 
production
 
of
 
short
 
parts
 
compared
 
to
 
traversing
 
grinders.
 
2.3  Manual  Cylindrical  Grinding  Machines  
While  automation  is  the  trend,  manual  machines  remain  vital  for  tool  and  die  shops  where  
every
 
job
 
is
 
unique.
 
Grindstone’s
 
manual
 
range
 
prioritizes
 
tactile
 
feedback
 
and
 
mechanical
 
simplicity.
 
2.3.1  Standard  Manual  Cylindrical  Grinder  ●  Target  Market:  Training  institutes,  small  repair  shops,  and  tool  rooms.  ●  Operational  Logic:  The  operator  hand-cranks  the  table  traverse  and  the  wheel  in-feed.  
This
 
gives
 
the
 
operator
 
granular
 
control
 
over
 
the
 
cutting
 
forces,
 
essential
 
when
 
grinding
 
delicate
 
or
 
thin-walled
 
parts.
 ●  Key  Specs:  ○  Grinding  Length:  300  mm.
2  
○  Job  Diameter:  80  mm.
2  

○  Wheel  Width:  40  mm.
2  
○  Price:  ~₹  2,15,000.
2  
2.3.2  Heavy-Duty  Manual  Variant  ●  Differentiation:  Increases  capacity  to  150  mm  diameter  and  incorporates  a  3  HP  wheel  
head
 
motor.
2  
●  Rigidity:  The  heavier  casting  required  for  the  150  mm  swing  and  3  HP  motor  reduces  
vibration,
 
allowing
 
for
 
heavier
 
cuts
 
(stock
 
removal)
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
standard
 
model.
 
3.  Specialized  Grinding  Solutions:  Niche  Industry  
Applications
 
A  significant  portion  of  Grindstone  Machinery  Industries'  value  proposition  lies  in  machines  
tailored
 
for
 
specific
 
industry
 
verticals.
 
These
 
are
 
not
 
general-purpose
 
tools
 
but
 
purpose-built
 
assets.
 
3.1  Stator  Core  Grinding  Machine  
Industry  Focus:  Electric  Motor  &  Ceiling  Fan  Manufacturing.  
The  efficiency  of  an  induction  motor  is  heavily  dependent  on  the  "Air  Gap"  between  the  stator  
and
 
the
 
rotor.
 
This
 
gap
 
must
 
be
 
minimal
 
and
 
consistent.
 
The
 
Stator
 
Core
 
Grinder
 
is
 
designed
 
solely
 
to
 
achieve
 
perfect
 
concentricity
 
and
 
size
 
on
 
the
 
stator
 
stack.
 
Technical  Deep  Dive:  ●  Component  Geometry:  Designed  for  Ceiling  Fan  Stators  with  ODs  ranging  from  200  mm  
to
 
300
 
mm.
13  
●  Slide  Mechanism:  The  machine  features  a  unique  "Both  Slide  Movable  Table"  design.  
Unlike
 
standard
 
grinders
 
where
 
the
 
table
 
moves
 
longitudinally,
 
this
 
machine
 
allows
 
adjustment
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
width
 
of
 
the
 
stator
 
stack
 
and
 
the
 
diameter
.
13  
●  Feed  System:  Manual  operation  via  precision  feed  screws  and  nuts.  This  suggests  the  
machine
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
batch
 
production
 
where
 
the
 
setup
 
is
 
fixed,
 
and
 
the
 
operator
 
loads/unloads
 
parts,
 
making
 
minor
 
adjustments
 
to
 
compensate
 
for
 
wheel
 
wear.
13  
●  Center  Height:  130  mm  to  150  mm.
13  
Website  Strategy:  This  product  should  be  marketed  with  keywords  like  "Ceiling  Fan  
Manufacturing
 
Machinery"
 
and
 
"Motor
 
Stator
 
OD
 
Grinder,"
 
as
 
it
 
serves
 
a
 
massive
 
domestic
 
market
 
in
 
India.
 
3.2  Scrubber  Machine  Roll  Grinding  Machine  

Industry  Focus:  Textile  Processing,  Industrial  Cleaning,  and  Steel  Rolling  Mills.  
"Scrubber  Rolls"  are  used  to  clean  surfaces  or  wring  out  liquids.  They  operate  in  wet,  
corrosive
 
environments
 
and
 
must
 
be
 
perfectly
 
cylindrical
 
to
 
apply
 
even
 
pressure.
 
Engineering  Highlights:  
●  Material  Compatibility:  The  machine  is  explicitly  rated  for  D2  Steel .
7
 D2  is  a  
high-carbon,
 
high-chromium
 
air-hardening
 
tool
 
steel
 
known
 
for
 
extreme
 
wear
 
resistance.
 
Grinding
 
D2
 
requires
 
a
 
machine
 
with
 
high
 
static
 
stiffness
 
to
 
prevent
 
"chatter"
 
(vibration
 
marks)
 
on
 
the
 
hard
 
surface.
 ●  Surface  Finish:  Capable  of  delivering  a  "Mirror  Finish".
7
 This  is  non-negotiable  for  roll  
grinding,
 
as
 
any
 
imperfection
 
on
 
the
 
roll
 
is
 
transferred
 
to
 
the
 
product
 
being
 
processed
 
(e.g.,
 
sheet
 
metal
 
or
 
fabric).
 ●  Capacity:  300  mm  Diameter  x  400  mm  Length.
7  
●  Power:  3-Phase  electrical  system,  necessary  for  the  high  torque  required  to  grind  D2  
steel.
7  
3.3  Carbide  Rod  Cylindrical  Grinding  Machine  
Industry  Focus:  Cutting  Tool  Manufacturing  (Drill  bits,  End  mills).  
Tungsten  Carbide  is  one  of  the  hardest  industrial  materials  (Second  only  to  diamond).  
Grinding
 
carbide
 
rods
 
requires
 
specialized
 
diamond
 
wheels
 
and
 
a
 
vibration-free
 
machine
 
base.
 
Technical  Specifications:  ●  Precision  Focus:  The  machine  is  optimized  for  small  diameter  work  (likely  80mm  swing,  
despite
 
the
 
snippet
 
ambiguity
 
of
 
800mm,
 
context
 
dictates
 
small
 
diameter
 
for
 
rods).
2  
●  Grinding  Length:  300  mm.
2  
●  Table  Travel:  320  mm.
2  
●  Center  Height:  115  mm.
2  
●  Implication:  The  reduced  center  height  (115  mm  vs.  standard  130  mm)  lowers  the  center  
of
 
gravity,
 
increasing
 
stability—a
 
critical
 
factor
 
when
 
grinding
 
brittle
 
carbide
 
materials.
 
4.  Internal  and  Centerless  Grinding  Technology  4.1  Internal  Grinding  Machines  
While  OD  grinding  shapes  the  shaft,  ID  (Internal  Diameter)  grinding  creates  the  precision  
bores
 
for
 
bearings
 
and
 
seals.
 

4.1.1  Dedicated  Internal  Grinder  ●  Range:  Extensive  capacity  from  5  mm  (tiny  bushings)  to  500  mm  (large  hydraulic  
cylinders).
2  
●  Depth  Capacity:  Can  grind  up  to  500  mm  deep.
2
 Deep  bore  grinding  is  notoriously  
difficult
 
due
 
to
 
"spindle
 
deflection"
 
(the
 
bending
 
of
 
the
 
grinding
 
quill).
 
Grindstone’s
 
ability
 
to
 
handle
 
500
 
mm
 
depths
 
implies
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
high-rigidity
 
quills
 
and
 
potentially
 
steady
 
rests.
 ●  Wheel  Specs:  Accommodates  wheels  as  small  as  10  mm.
2  
4.2  Centerless  Grinding  Machines  
Centerless  grinding  removes  the  need  to  mount  the  workpiece  between  centers,  allowing  for  
continuous,
 
high-speed
 
production
 
of
 
cylindrical
 
parts
 
like
 
dowel
 
pins
 
and
 
shock
 
absorber
 
rods.
 
4.2.1  Hydraulic  Centerless  Grinder  
●  Process:  Through-feed  grinding.
2
 The  part  is  fed  between  the  grinding  wheel  and  a  
regulating
 
wheel.
 ●  Capacity:  100  mm  –  150  mm  diameter.
2  
●  Wheel  Dimensions:  350  mm  (Grinding  Wheel)  x  150  mm  (Width).
2
 The  150  mm  width  
allows
 
for
 
substantial
 
stock
 
removal
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
pass.
 ●  Automation:  Automatic  grade  
2
,  making  it  suitable  for  integration  with  vibratory  bowl  
feeders
 
for
 
"lights-out"
 
manufacturing.
 
5.  The  Coolant  Filtration  Ecosystem:  Magnetic  
Separators
 
Precision  grinding  is  impossible  without  effective  coolant  management.  Grinding  creates  
"swarf"
 
(fine
 
metal
 
chips)
 
and
 
releases
 
abrasive
 
grit.
 
If
 
this
 
is
 
recirculated,
 
it
 
scratches
 
the
 
workpiece
 
and
 
clogs
 
the
 
wheel.
 
Grindstone
 
manufactures
 
the
 
filtration
 
hardware
 
to
 
prevent
 
this.
 
5.1  Magnetic  Coolant  Separators  
These  units  utilize  a  rotating  magnetic  drum  to  continuously  extract  ferrous  contamination  
from
 
the
 
coolant
 
stream.

Operational  Mechanism:  1.  Dirty  coolant  flows  over  the  magnetic  drum.  2.  Ferrite  magnets  inside  the  drum  attract  ferrous  particles  to  the  drum  surface.  3.  A  synthetic  rubber  roller  squeezes  the  sludge  to  remove  excess  liquid.
14  
4.  A  scraper  blade  removes  the  dry  sludge  into  a  bin,  and  clean  coolant  returns  to  the  tank.  
Application:  These  are  standard  equipment  for  surface  grinders,  cylindrical  grinders,  and  
honing
 
machines.

6.  Precision  Accessories:  The  Science  of  Wheel  
Maintenance
 
A  grinding  machine  is  only  as  good  as  the  condition  of  its  wheel.  Grindstone  manufactures  the  

critical  accessories  required  to  "Dress"  (sharpen/shape)  and  "Balance"  the  wheel.  
6.1  Angle  and  Radius  Dressers  
Over  time,  grinding  wheels  lose  their  shape.  Dressers  utilize  diamond  or  CBN  tools  to  cut  the  
abrasive
 
wheel
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
correct
 
geometry.
 
6.1.1  Wheel  Dresser  Radius  Angle  
●  Geometry  Control:  Capable  of  dressing  angles  from  0°  to  180°.
15
 This  allows  the  creation  
of
 
complex
 
profiles
 
on
 
the
 
wheel
 
face.
 ●  Precision:  Features  an  accuracy  of  ±5′  (Five  Minutes  of  a  degree)  with  1°  graduation  
markings.
15  
●  Tooling:  Uses  a  Single  Point  CBN  (Cubic  Boron  Nitride)  stone.
15
 CBN  is  harder  than  the  
aluminum
 
oxide
 
wheels
 
typically
 
used
 
for
 
steel,
 
ensuring
 
long
 
tool
 
life.
 ●  Mounting:  Table  mounted,  making  it  compatible  with  universal  cylindrical  grinders.
15  
6.1.2  Wheel  Angle  Radius  Dressing  Device  
●  Articulation:  360-degree  rotation  capability.
15  
●  Mechanism:  Hand-wheel  operated  for  smooth,  controlled  motion  during  the  radius  
dressing
 
sweep.
15  
●  Structure:  Heavy  12  Kg  Cast  Iron  construction  to  absorb  the  vibration  generated  when  
the
 
diamond
 
contacts
 
the
 
spinning
 
wheel.
15  
●  Function:  Specifically  designed  for  creating  convex  and  concave  radii  on  the  wheel  
corners,
 
essential
 
for
 
grinding
 
fillet
 
radii
 
on
 
shafts
 
to
 
reduce
 
stress
 
concentrations.
 
6.2  Wheel  Balancing  Technology  
An  unbalanced  wheel  spinning  at  2000  RPM  creates  centrifugal  forces  that  manifest  as  
vibration.
 
This
 
vibration
 
transfers
 
to
 
the
 
workpiece,
 
creating
 
"chatter
 
marks"
 
(visible
 
waves).
 
6.2.1  Wheel  Balancing  Stand  ●  Method:  Static  Balancing.  The  wheel  assembly  is  placed  on  parallel  knife-edges  or  
rollers.
 
Gravity
 
causes
 
the
 
heavy
 
side
 
to
 
rotate
 
to
 
the
 
bottom.
 
Weights
 
are
 
then
 
adjusted
 
on
 
the
 
wheel
 
flange
 
until
 
the
 
wheel
 
remains
 
stationary
 
at
 
any
 
position.
 ●  Capacity:  300  mm  to  1200  mm  diameter  wheels.
5  
●  Construction:  Cast  Iron  (CI)  base  for  stability.
5  
●  Customization:  Grindstone  offers  custom  center  heights  and  widths,  accommodating  
different
 
arbor
 
lengths.

7.  Spindle  Technology:  The  Heart  of  Precision  

The  spindle  is  the  most  critical  component  of  any  machine  tool.  It  dictates  the  runout  
(wobble)
 
and
 
stiffness
 
of
 
the
 
machine.
 
Grindstone
 
manufactures
 
these
 
in-house,
 
demonstrating
 
high-level
 
machining
 
capabilities.
 
7.1  Internal  Grinding  Spindles  (Belt  Driven)  
Internal  grinding  requires  high  RPM  because  the  wheels  are  small  (to  fit  inside  holes).  To  
achieve
 
proper
 
Surface
 
Feet
 
Per
 
Minute
 
(SFPM),
 
a
 
10mm
 
wheel
 
must
 
spin
 
much
 
faster
 
than
 
a
 
400mm
 
wheel.
 
Technical  Specifications:  
●  Max  Speed:  Up  to  35,000  RPM  (for  100mm  dia  variant).
4  
●  Runout  Accuracy:  2  Microns  (0.002  mm).
4
 This  is  aerospace-grade  precision.  ●  Bearing  Technology:  Uses  NSK  Matched  Pair  Angular  Contact  Bearings .
4
 Angular  
contact
 
bearings
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
handle
 
both
 
radial
 
loads
 
(cutting
 
force)
 
and
 
axial
 
loads
 
(side
 
thrust),
 
and
 
"matched
 
pairs"
 
ensure
 
the
 
load
 
is
 
shared
 
perfectly
 
evenly.
 ●  Material:  EN  Series  Steel  (likely  EN24  or  EN31),  hardened  and  ground  for  longevity.

and
 
Application
 
(Roll
 
Grinding
 
vs.
 
Tool
 
Room).
 2.  Technical  Data  Tables:  Use  the  tables  provided  in  Sections  2,  5,  and  7  directly  on  the  
product
 
pages.
 
B2B
 
buyers
 
scan
 
for
 
specific
 
capacities
 
(e.g.,
 
"600mm
 
center
 
distance")
 
before
 
reading
 
descriptions.
 3.  Cross-Linking:  Link  "Grinding  Machines"  to  "Magnetic  Separators"  and  "Wheel  
Balancers"
 
as
 
Essential
 
Accessories
.
 
This
 
drives
 
internal
 
traffic
 
and
 
increases
 
average
 
order
 
value.
 

4.  Content  Tone:  Maintain  the  "Engineering-First"  tone.  Use  terms  like  "Dwell  at  Reversal,"  
"Hydrodynamic
 
Lubrication,"
 
and
 
"Angular
 
Contact
 
Bearings"
 
to
 
signal
 
expertise
 
to
 
technical
 
buyers.
 
This  report  provides  the  exhaustive  technical  foundation  required  to  position  Grindstone
